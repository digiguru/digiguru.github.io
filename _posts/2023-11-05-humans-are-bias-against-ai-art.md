Humans are bias against AI art, and that's been scientifically proven.

In a study this year called "Bias against AI art can enhance perceptions of human creativity." 2,965 participants were shown a mix of AI art and non AI art. They were asked to rate them across a number of dimensions ...

- Liking
- Skill
- Colour
- Inspiration
- Brightness
- Complexity
- Emotional Evocation
- Expense


(the last being whether they thought the image looked expensive)

The scientists discovered that on all the dimensions art labelled as "AI" scored lower to participants than art labelled as "human".


This was true whether or not the source was correctly labelled


This proves that humans are bias against AI. It was most notable in monetary value and perceived skill.

Interestingly more than 70% of participants indicated they could not differentiate between AI-made and human-made images without the labels.


They also found that technically minded people were just as bias as other participants.


Many other studies have taken these findings and replicated them in similar ways.

I am unashamedly an AI artist, but I haven't included the #aiart hashtag in a number of months. Since then I've also seen an increase in engagement.  I wonder if the two are related? Do you also find that not labeling your work as AI helps with your reach?
