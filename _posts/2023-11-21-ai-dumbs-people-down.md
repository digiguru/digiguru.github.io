Running a session on the use of AI tools in the workplace and education I was asked the following question...

 > Will students not lose such skills as planning and writing essays in answer to questions? Will independent and original thinking be impaired by dependence on AI to answer questions?

I think this is a fascinating insight in to people's fears that AI is going to dumb down humanity. A thought so potent Mike Judge made his 2006 film Idiocracy about it. Now to answer the question I'll start with a brief tour of similar thoughts through history.

I think there's 4 epochs in history this can relate to.

 * The invention of the book
 * The invention of mass publishing
 * The invention of the internet
 * The invention of mobile internet

If these events have impacted human intelligence in a detrimental way, we can safely AI will do so as well.
