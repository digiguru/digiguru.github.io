Had a really frustrating error in the web project where the following error message appeared...

The Controls collection cannot be modified because the control contains code blocks (i.e. &lt;% ... %&gt;).
<!--break-->
I looked through my application and saw that I had the following code....
<pre>&lt;head id="Head1" runat="server"&gt;
    &lt;script language="javascript" type="text/javascript" src="/js/MasterJS.aspx?u=&lt;%=ConfigurationManager.AppSettings("UpdateNumber")%&gt;"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;asp:ContentPlaceHolder ID="ScriptExtra" runat="server"&gt;&lt;/asp:ContentPlaceHolder&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;</pre>
but I also inject into the header Meta information and title pages from my application using a nice little function to keep our Meta information in check.

As a result - I needed to change all references from
<pre>&lt;%#ConfigurationManager.AppSettings("UpdateNumber")%&gt;</pre>
to
<pre>&lt;%=ConfigurationManager.AppSettings("UpdateNumber")%&gt;</pre>
As I result I needed to change all my headers that are runat="server" to use

I needed to change all references that are found in the head from an equals to a hash.

I used the following regular expression to find all references of a head with a runat server...

[\&lt;]head[^\&gt;]*runat="server"[^\&gt;]*&gt;

152 files.
