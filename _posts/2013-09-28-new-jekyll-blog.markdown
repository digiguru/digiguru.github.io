Hi

My name is Adam Hall. A father of 2 boys, & head of development for the UK's largest wedding website.

I work in a small team in the UK, and manage some more devs over seas.
<!--break-->
I've just migrated my blogging platform into [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), meaning I can easily write posts in [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) and have a nice static site that keeps the template throughout.

Migrating blogs to jekyll is [super easy](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/migrations/) - even using [blogger](http://blog.coolaj86.com/articles/migrate-from-blogger-to-ruhoh-with-proper-redirects.html)

Hopefully if I try to get a post up every week, I will be able to collate my findings as a web developer.
