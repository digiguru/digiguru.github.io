Hi. I've been meaning to become a part of the online community for quite some time. I've had my <a href="http://digiguru.net/">anti-site</a> online since 2000, and <a href="http://artistsgarden.wordpress.com/">my Mum </a>has been blogging for ages. I've helped out in the <a href="http://www.holidayautos.co.uk/">car industry</a>, the <a href="http://www.live-org.com/home/index.aspx">property sector</a> and now addressing <a href="http://www.hitched.co.uk/">weddings</a>.<br /><br />I am always trying to think up great ways of interacting and using the web like my <a href="http://vi.ctori.es/">online predictions league</a> or, of course - <a href="http://www.noelsbum.com/">noel's bum</a>.<br /><br />I have a big idea brewing at the moment, so watch this space for the announcement of a new code project in .NET and SQL Server.
